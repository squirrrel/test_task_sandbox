__1. Tell us about the most challenging/interesting task you've solved. It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.__

The notion of bringing some use and investing in the overall performance, improving things, creating something useful - all those things are important to me and I feel proud of myself whenever I am productive there.

my very first experience in the field of the IT, when in shirt terms I managed to learned Ruby from scratch and started to manage a testing framework and writing automation tests. That seemed like a miracle to me)

__2. Can you recommend the interesting technical book or article you've read recently?  What did you like in it?__

the main reason I liked most of these articles and found them useful as opposed to the ones of the same topic, but written by other authors, is that they do give an in-depth information, cover the very internal implementations etc., while others are consistent, well structured and complete overviews/summaries supplied with some handy code snippets and real-life examples

__3. What did you like and dislike on your last position?__

Pros: autonomy, no micromanagement, they cared about refactoring, optimization and security
Cons: on the other hand it was hard to push code, because senior colleagues over-reviewed code and imposed their own "right" view on how it was supposed to be done. Bad communication at times

## To run all tests set:
```
cd test_task_sandbox
rspec
```
